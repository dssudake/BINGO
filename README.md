# BINGO

The project that I have buit is the fun game  BINGO!! 

**Rules** of the game are as follows :
    
    • The numbers vary from 1 to 25 are arranged in a random sequence in a 5X5 matrix .
    • Each player has to say a number in alternate moves.
    • Each player has to remove number from matrix said by opponent.
    • The game ends when either one of the player will finish 5 rows/columns/diagonal of the matrix in any random sequence.
    • The first one to do this will win game and the game is terminated.
    • This game can also be played in a matrix of any dimension.
